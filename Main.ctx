Preface:
This is universal Context-lmtx checklist for creating any template with context from scratch.
within following this higherarchy you can make a context template without messing up things and it improves your functionality and effectiveness so much
By following this you earn some important benefits:
1. simply divide your projects between the team
2. refrence ditionary for differnt functional tools of context
3. overview to your work
4. ability to make progression bar
5. quick overview of what you learned from context
6. good refrence for teaching context essentials to new learners
7. review general notes and tips under each step(such as using AI)

So let's start it!

\startsection[title:🧱 Page & Layout Setup]
1. Define Paper Size and Orientation
Use a small portrait size like paperheight=180mm, paperwidth=110mm for mobile-friendly design.

2. Set Margins and Text Width
Use narrow margins and wider text area for better readability on small screens.

3. Define Background Color or Image
Use \setupbackgrounds[page][background=...] to apply a background color or image.

4. Setup Fonts and Sizes
Choose a legible sans-serif font (\setupbodyfont[modern,11pt]) optimized for screens.

5. Configure Line Spacing (Leading)
Use \setupinterlinespace[line=...pt] for readable line spacing.
