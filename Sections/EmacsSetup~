Emacs Setup and Hints:
This is the file that describe the steps to setup our editor for using within context
why we use emacs?
because it's so flexible and light. you can setup your favorites and has lot of intersting features
also you can use any editor you want but my suggestion is emacs.

Setuping emacs:

1. add compile and run
2. auto close parenthesis
3. auto start stop creation
4. save the windows of emacs you have worked on like a project window
5. define keybindings for switching windows
